Hello! My name is Reese Parker. I am 25 years old and was born and raised in North Carolina. I love animals of all sorts but if I had to pick, my top 3 animals would be hedgehogs, guinea pigs, and fennec foxes. I am interested in learning more about how to use HTML and updating my knowledge set in it.
# About Me
## My Interests
In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, drawing, and playing with my dogs. I have a growing interest in animation and 3D modeling and I am teaching myself to use Blender and Adobe After Effects. 

Academically, I am interested in pursuing ux design and already possess a degree in graphic design. I hope to use my skills in graphic Design to improve my designs for UX. My goal is to find an internship in ux design after graduation.
## Websites I Recommend
1. [UX Library](https://www.uxlibrary.org/)

    I find UX Library to be a great website for finding helpful resources for your UX projects. You can read about UX Design, take design courses, gather free resource kits, and more. I found the icon tools to be great placeholders in early itterations of my designs.

2. [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

    W3 Schools is a great place to learn different coding languages, practice them, and quiz yourself. It is also a helpful website to refer to when you are stuck and need examples.
